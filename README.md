Tools for extracting the face (maybe more coming soon) data from TTGames wii models
Documentation coming soon
(source code maybe too)

At this point, there should hopefully be few depencencies as long as you have windows.

Also, only models at this point, hopefully I will be able to find UV data or Normal data(maybe in a seperate project)
