WARNING - On some formats, the larger the model is, it takes exponentially more inefficient, also taking exponentially longer to complete (its just not programmed efficiently) (hopefully fix coming soon)

Tools for extracting the face (maybe more coming soon) data from TTGames wii models
Documentation coming soon
(source code maybe too)

Formats explained here

At this point, there should hopefully be few depencencies as long as you have windows.

Also, only models at this point, hopefully I will be able to find UV data or Normal data(maybe in a seperate project)

To make use of the data to get a proper model, you will first need to get the vertex list extracted.  (tutorial here) https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PcbEJ1aIb1oUqjC4ZBZZHl4jCXdoGqIZHy9CetpV1sc/edit?usp=sharing
